# customer-churn-prediction
Machine Learning project to predict customer churn based on historical data. The model analyzes customer behavior and identifies key factors influencing churn using techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model evaluation, and SHAP-based explainability.

## 📘 Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. It analyzes customer behavior and identifies factors leading to churn, with model explainability using SHAP.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- XGBoost, SHAP
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for web app demo)
